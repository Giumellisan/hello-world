Just another notorious repo

Dear github I have to wip myself to get ahead and do stuff. It is tough to motivate my lazy ass, but I get a hang of it. 

I commit to learning everything necessary to use git in a satisfactory way. 

Programming is also just like learning a language, languages is what I love!
